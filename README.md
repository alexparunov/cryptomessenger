# Steganographer
An Android application which allows users to hide text or image within the image and be able to share it using external messaging applications. In addition to that, users are able to extract the embedded text or image from the stegoed image. This establishes a secure way to share a classified message. The steganography is performed by encrypting the message using random 24-bit key and the message is embedded using Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm. The high resolution of cover image enables to hide approximately 560 MB of message.
